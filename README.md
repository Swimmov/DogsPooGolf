*If you any time took dog outside and cleaned after - you should understand*
### The Idea: 
1. Choose the size of your dog 
2. Choose the breed.
3. Feed it with food: 
- for Morning, 
- for Evening;
- extra water (Yes/No); 
4. Go for a walk.
5. When you dog pooped, clean after (don't forget a bag :)) and than throw when you are ready .

Distance depends on the set of the food was chosen.

if you did get into the trash bin – you win. 
If your opponent did it - he wins. 
If nobody did it - winner is a player who did it closely to the garbage can;

If you choose One Player - you play against your CPU or
You can choose Two Players to play against each other.
